  Jenkins default image details

**Jenkins Operator** is fully compatible with **`jenkins:lts`** Docker image and does not introduce any hidden changes to the upstream Jenkins.

If needed, the Docker image can be easily changed in custom resource manifest as long as it supports standard Jenkins file system structure.
The Jenkins Operator provides a convenient way to build your own Jenkins images based on any jenkins:lts using the Jenkins Image controller.
